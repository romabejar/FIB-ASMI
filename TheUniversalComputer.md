## About the book ##

- Title: The Universal Computer: The Road from Leibniz to Turing.
- Author: Martin Davis.

I did decide to read the book in english as I've been wanting to challenge myself in reading a wide text in this language for a long time, so I thought that was the perfect moment for it. For in case there is any difference between versions, I have used the epub - PDF version from the version date above, which have been purchased on amazon.

## About the author ##

The author is Martin Davis. His parents were Jewish immigrants to the US from Poland. He grew up in the Bronx and his parents encouraged him to obtain a full education. He received his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1950 and now he is a professor at New York University. A year after his graduation, while he was teaching a course at the University of Illinois based on Alan Turing ideas, a student said to him that a pair of machines that were an embodiment of Turing ideas were being build across the street. So he started to write software for these early computers.

Now I am going to give a short explanation of the contents of the main parts of the book following the index and giving some of my personal thoughts of each part after the brief explanation:

### 1. Leibniz's Dream ###

The book starts with Leibniz life, him being a very optimistic person who had a wonderful idea. That idea was that a machine capable of performing calculus, and freeing people from the time consuming task of calculations in order to be able to use all the time in scientific uses.

It impresses me the fact that a man thought about a machine that could perform this tasks in his environment, he was a man that lived from 1646-1716 and having the idea of a thing that needed all the concepts that are explained in the book from people that lived after him just to be able to be built, is really impressive.

Leibniz's another idea was that a language that represents exactly the human reasoning could be developed and that having such a language would be highly useful as it would allow to perform operations in a mathematical way about everything.

It seems to me that this language idea could have been an inspiration for programming languages, and it is really impressive that approximately 250 years before the first computer was built, he already had this idea.


### 2. Boole Turns Logic into Algebra ###

George Boole had a hard life, in his early years he had to maintain his family as he was a genius and his father's business was failing. He created a school in his town after getting some studies.

He arrived to the conclusion that premises and conclusions should be representable by sentences of one of the following four types:

| Sentence type | Example |
| :------------ | :------ |
| All X are Y   | All horses are animals. |
| No X are Y    | No trees are animals. |
| Some X are Y  | Some horses are pure-breed. |
| Some X are not Y | Some horses are not pure-breed. |

With that and the algebra applied to this that was another brick to construct the calculus ratiocinator that Leibniz had sought.

### 3. Frege: From Breakthrough to Despair ###

Frege provided the first fully developed system of logic that encompassed all of the deductive reasoning in ordinary mathematics.

As Michael Dummett I find the fact that Frege was an anti-semite ironic, as thinking that a man that contributes mathematical logic should have been a rational man.

Freges's Begriffsschrift: is a formula language, modeled upon that of arithmetic, for pure thought. In Frege's Begriffsschrift sentences would be analyzed with **if ... then ...** logical relationships, and connecting sentences with **... and ...**, he would put an x to describe some value ant then he added the symbols for **For all** and **Exists some**.

With that and the rest of the notation, that starts to seem like the logic that has been taught to us in university.


### 4. Cantor: Detour through Infinity ###

Cantor studied about infinities and cardinalities of sets. He discovered several things like:
- An infinite set's parts can be as big as the whole set. For example: There is one even number for each natural number (it's double for example)
- Infinite sets come in different sizes. There are enough cardinal numbers for the set of rational numbers, but there are not enough cardinal numbers for the set of irrational numbers.
- The diagonal Method: Seems important but i didn't get it in the book.

## Extra Notes ##

He llegit fins el capitol de Gödel i el trobo un llibre prou interesant per disfrutarlo, pero el fet de tenir la feina per poder pagar la uni i les 4 assignatures per poder acabar la uni d'una vegada fa que no hagi pogut llegir més i encara menys fer el treballet de la llargada requerida. Espero que això compti algo ja que es tot lo que he pogut fer, per la meva banda dir, que probablement me'l llegeixi tranquilament a l'estiu aquest llibre.
