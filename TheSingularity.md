For this book Review I started with the kindle ebook version of the book, but for the fact that I literaly had almost no time to read, I decided to search the audiobook in ThePirateBay, and I found it, which makes "The Singularity is Near" the first audiobook I've listened. I live in Sentmenat, work in Viladecavalls and study in Barcelona, that is more than two hours a day driving, so in that moments is when I have read this book. The experience of "reading" this book as an audiobook, has been greatly enjoyable, because it brought the feeling of using my time in a very efficient way because, I was doing two things that I needed to do at the same time without complication. In addition the thematic of the book was very enjoyable. Finally, I thing that all this paragraph was necessary because the purpose of this book review is supposed to demonstrate that the reading of the book has brought some benefit to me, and I think that listening this audiobook has brought the highest benefit to me on this year, because now I have 30GB of audiobooks downloaded, and this experience has shown me that there are some tasks of the day that are very compatible with consuming books: driving, running, home cleaning tasks etc. And I think that the incorporation of this possibility to my life is quite a benefit with lifetime impact.

## About the Author ##

Ray Kurzweil, the author of this book, is an American who grew up in New York. Since he was little he knew that he wanted to be an inventor and he arrived to the conclusion that he needed some method to predict when and what needed products to be introduced in the market. Thinking about this he arrived to the idea of the Law of Accelerating Returns. He owns several companies based on his inventions from several areas.

## Topics covered by the book ##

The book covers a large amount of concepts, all to explain what is the Singularity and why is it true that it will happens.
The book starts explaining that there are 6 epochs of the evolution of the universe: Starting with Physics and chemistry, then Biology and DNA, Brains, Technology, Merge of Brains and Techonology, and then the last one where "The Universe wakes up". The last one is very filossofical and for many is probably very science fiction, but the author really covers a lot of how that is gonna be possible with well exposed ideas.

In the second chapter the Law of Accelerating Returns is explained. It consists in the fact that any evolutionary system follows an exponential form so there is always a point when it skyrockets to a very distant state from the previous state. That idea was very interesting because it seems a very important concept to have in mind, because, 100 years ago the changes in peoples life were very few compared to nowadays, that we have incorporated internet, mobile phones and soon auto-driven cars.

In the next two chapters the author explains how we will reach the hardware and software capacity to computate a human brain. The hardware part just consist in the new possible hardware paradigms that will appear and that the can clearly outperform the current one. The software part consists in having nano-bots scanning our brain from inside to collect the data required to produce the brain software. What most impacted me about this chapters wasn't in the book, it was in an article that I read in Xataka -> https://www.xataka.com/medicina-y-salud/los-nanorobots-ya-pueden-comunicarse-y-coordinarse-entre-ellos-un-diminuto-paso-para-el-hombre-un-gran-paso-para-la-ciencia
If we are already at the point in where nano-bots can communicate with each other, and knowing that all that cells do can be done way better and controlled by nano-bots  I think that it really means that the Singularity is really near.

The next chapter are more justifications of why Singularity will happen, which dangers can come with it, which benefits will come with it and criticisms very well debated by Ray Kurzweil.
